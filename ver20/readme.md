# Morse Code Encoder/Decoder, version 2

## About this version

- This version of code is unnecessarily verbose and there is much room for improvement.
- We need conversion table for transmitting telegram.
- If a programming language supports built-in `key-value` data structure, we can create the conversion table very easily. But C-programming language doesn't support `Hashmap` nor `Dictionary` data structure. So we can try array data structure first.
- Arrays are basic data structures, but their use is never basic and difficult. In particular, handling strings using arrays and pointers is quite tricky.
